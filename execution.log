Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the
last "terraform apply":

  # azurerm_resource_group.my-project has been changed
  ~ resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my-project" {
        id       = "/subscriptions/f8b8aeef-be02-4eb0-9430-b53bccb55fb7/resourceGroups/my-project-resources"
        name     = "my-project-resources"
      + tags     = {}
        # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
    }

Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.
